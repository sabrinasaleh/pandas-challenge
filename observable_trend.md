## Observation 3: Trend by Item Popularity & Item Profitability
Analyses of most popular items and most profitable items provide interesting insights. Oathbreaker (item-id 178) tops in both the lists; it's the most popular item with 12 purchase count and most profitable item with $50.76 total purchase value. Next, Nirvana (item-id 82) and Fiery Glass Crusader appear in both the list where both have purchase count of 9; Nirvana's total purchase value is $44.10 and Fiery Glass Crusader's total purchase value is $41.22.

Extraction (item_id 108) and Pursuit (item-id 19) make it to the list of most popular items with purchase count of 9 and 8 respectively. However, both the games can't make it to the list of most profitable items; that is because their item prices are relatively low compared to that of other most protibale games (Extraction's item price is $3.53 and Pursuit's item price is $1.02).
